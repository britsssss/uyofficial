<h2>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING:</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

 <h2>INTRODUCTION TO WINDOWS FORM IDE:
</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>Windows Forms is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) class library which is bundled in .Net Framework. Its main purpose is to provide an easier interface to develop the applications for desktop, tablet, PCs.
</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It is also termed as the WinForms. The applications which are developed by using Windows Forms or WinForms are known as the Windows Forms Applications that runs on the desktop computer. 
</blockquote>
 </br>
 <hr>
 <h2>THE TOOLBOX:</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>If you accidentally remove the toolbox by clicking the X instead, you can make it reappear by selecting Toolbox from the View menu, or by pressing Ctrl-Alt-X. The toolbox contains a selection of all the controls available to you as a .NET developer.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>. In particular, it provides the selection that is of importance to you as a Windows Application developer. If you had chosen to create a Web Forms project,rather than a Windows Application, you would have been given a different toolbox to use.
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote> You are not limited to use this selection. You can customize the toolbox to fit your needs.
 </blockquote>  
 </br>
 <hr>
 <h2>CONTROLS:</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>Most controls in .NET derive from the System.Windows.Forms.Control class.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>This class defines the basic functionality of the controls, which is why many properties and events in the controls we&#39;ll see are identical. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>Some controls, named custom or user controls, derive from another class: System.Windows.Forms.UserControl. </blockquote>
 </br>
 <hr>
 <h2>PROPERTIES</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>All controls have a number of properties that are used to manipulate the behavior of the control.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The base class of most controls, Control, has a number of properties that other controls either inherit directly or override to provide some kind of custom behavior.
</blockquote>
 </br>
 <hr>
 <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
 <br>
 <blockquote>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model where programs are organized around objects and data rather than action and logic</blockquote>
 <blockquote>OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and functions around these objects.
</blockquote>

 <h2>The four Pillars</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Abstraction Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.</li>
 <li>Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions</li>
 <li>Inheritance Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.</li>
 <li>Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.</li>
</ul>
